I didn't know before I embraced you
The world I stayed in is like this
something brilliant
The person I reached with a small breath
The love that called me fearlessly
very good
I'm excited to watch you
I was ridiculously jealous
all the ordinary moments
dark eternity
into that long wait
You came down like the sunlight
I didn't know before letting you go
The world I stayed in is like this
a lonely thing
This place where beautiful flowers bloom and die
The season called you that will never happen again
I got greedy
live with you and grow old
holding wrinkled hands
that my life was warm
blessing only once
After that brief encounter
You cried like rain
happy once in a while
wish
did it make you cry
forget everything and live
i will find you
Your breath, when you call me again
I won't forget
I'm excited to watch you
I was ridiculously jealous
all the moments you gave me
meet someday
the day we will be the happiest
I will go like the first snow
i will come to you
