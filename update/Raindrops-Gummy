My night was frozen by the cold wind
Before I knew it, time passed
I'm getting dull
You give me a warm side
Like a flower that blooms in midwinter
In the barely season
cried and laughed
walking alone
Hug me when I was passing away
cold even in spring
my pain
The numb day no one knows
whatever you say
You made me smile without need
The pouring raindrops are now
stopped
I heard your breath someday
Even if I endured it, the words that flowed
tears in it
Lean next to me now
I couldn't erase
The countless love placed in front of us
I will protect these words
I promise you, holding your hand
like this
cold even in spring
my pain
The numb day no one knows
whatever you say
You made me smile without need
The pouring raindrops are now
stopped
